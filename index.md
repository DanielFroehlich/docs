# Cloud Patterns

This effort is focused on customer solutions that involve multiple Red Hat
products.

Cloud Patterns are natural progression from reference architectures with
additional value.

Reference Architectures are often speculative, single point in time
configurations, which tend to break after product versions evolve over time.

They are rarely maintained over time because the manual process of reconciling
changes to multiple underlying products them is time consuming.

For those with deployment details, the documentation is written and the user has
to either copy and paste the individual steps or type them in themselves based
on their unique implementation.

For Cloud Patterns, we look for novel customer use cases - some horizontally,
others vertically-focused, validate them with the relevant product engineering
teams, and create publically available GitOps-based automation to make them
easily repeatable and extendable.

The automation also enables the solution to be added to CI, with triggers for
new product versions (including betas), so that we can proactively find and fix
breakage and avoid bit-rot.
