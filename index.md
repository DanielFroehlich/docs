# Solution Atlases

Solution Atlases are natural progression from reference architectures with
additional value.

This effort is focused on customer solutions that involve multiple Red Hat
products.

We look for novel customer use cases, validates them with the relevant product
engineering teams, and create GitOps based automation to make them easily
repeatable and extendable.

The automation also enables the solution to be added to CI, with triggers for
new product versions (including betas), so that we can proactively find and fix
breakage and avoid bit-rot.
