## Background
Organizations are looking for a way to develop and deploy applications on open hybrid cloud in a stable, simple, and secure way. This hybrid approach includes multi-cloud delpoyments where workloads may be running on different clusters on different clouds - private or public. This also requires an infrastructutre-as-code approach that manages versions and being able to deploy based on specific deloyment configurations. 

## Architecture
At a high level this requires a management hub, for DevOps and GitOps, and and infrastructure that extends to more than one datacenter running on private or public clouds.
